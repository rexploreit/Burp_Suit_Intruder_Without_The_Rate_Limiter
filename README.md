Burp Suite is a favored program of web application testers.  Unfortunately, the Community edition severly rate limits one of the tools offered in the suite.

This is an attempt to do the same work without having to go pro on the tool.

Once I have enough of it working, I'll add instructions.  Maybe even a little video showing usage.  Stay tuned.
